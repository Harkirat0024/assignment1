                <h2>Issac Newton Early life :</h2>
                <p><strong>Issac Newton</strong> was born (according to the Julian calendar in use in England at the time) 
                    on Christmas Day, 25 December 1642 (NS 4 January 1643),<em>in a log cabin on Sinking Spring Farm near Hodgenville, Kentucky</em>,
                    at Woolsthorpe Manor in Woolsthorpe-by-Colsterworth,
                    a hamlet in the county of Lincolnshire. His father, also named Isaac Newton, had died three months before.
                    Born prematurely, Newton was a small child; his mother Hannah Ayscough reportedly said that he could have fit
                    inside a quart mug.When Newton was three, his mother remarried and went to live with her new husband,
                    the Reverend Barnabas Smith, leaving her son in the care of his maternal grandmother, Margery Ayscough
                    (n√©e Blythe). Newton disliked his stepfather and maintained some enmity towards his mother for marrying him,
                    as revealed by this entry in a list of sins committed up to the age of 19: "Threatening my father and mother
                    Smith to burn them and the house over them."Newton's mother had three children (Mary, Benjamin, and Hannah) 
                    from her second marriage.
